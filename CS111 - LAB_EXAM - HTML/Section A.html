    <h1>Welcome to First Webpage</h1>

    <p>
        Creating web pages is a skill I've been familiar with since my high school days, where I initially learned the basics of HTML. Back then, we used Notepad as our IDE because of its simplicity in setting up.
        <br>Fast forward to today, and my web development journey has evolved. I now leverage Visual Studio 2022 for coding, finding its advanced features, including predictive coding and enhanced visual representations, to be incredibly beneficial.
