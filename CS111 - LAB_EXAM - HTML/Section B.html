    <h1>Welcome to Second Webpage</h1>


    <p>
        My introduction to HTML in high school laid the foundation, but using Visual Studio has added a new level of efficiency to my coding experience. The IDE's predictive capabilities make coding smoother by anticipating and suggesting code snippets, saving time and reducing errors.
        <br> The enhanced visual representations in Visual Studio contribute to better code readability, a factor that I find crucial for maintaining and collaborating on projects.
